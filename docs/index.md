# Be-Secure Schema Definitions

An easy-to-use data format that maps precisely to various data exchange needs between cybersecurity analysts and security labs. These schema definitions address many of the shortcomings of dealing with vulnerabilities in open source software and ML models in Be-Secure ecosystem.

These unified format means that vulnerability databases, open source users, and security researchers can easily share tooling and consume vulnerabilities across all of open source. This means a more complete view of vulnerabilities in open source for everyone, as well as faster detection and remediation times resulting from easier automation.

Be-Secure Eco System Entities are.
- Open source projects of interest(OSSPoI)
- Open source vulnerabilities of interest( OSSVoI)
- Open source models of Interest (OSMoI)
- BeS Environments
- BeS Playbooks
- BeS Assessments
- BeS Exploit & Attack Simuation (EAS)
- BeSLabs
