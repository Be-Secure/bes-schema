## Open Source Software Projects of Interest(OSSPoI)

Collection of Open Source Software Projects relevant to the Organization's interests. These projects undergo security assessments to uncover vulnerabilities, subsequently rectified through patches.

## BeSLAB

BeSLab is an open source security lab dedicated to fortifying open source projects against potential vulnerabilities. Designed to operate efficiently even in low-resource settings, BeSLab provides a comprehensive solution that grants complete control and transparency to application security and security operations teams. Additionally, it serves as a valuable resource for security researchers by streamlining the process of bringing open source projects under scrutiny and significantly reducing remediation time.

## BLIman

BLIman is a command line interface tool for creating/managing BeSLab. The tool can also be used to onboard projects, vulnerabilities, ml models, datasets etc to the lab.

## Open Source Software Vulnerabilities of Interest ( OSSVoI )

A collection of vulnerabilities that affects the OSSPoI. These vulnerabilities can be found during assessments on the OSSPoI inside the lab or onboarded from external sources.

## BeSLighthouse

A dashboard project for visulaizing the security assessment and risk posture of open source projects and ML models tracked by a BeSLAB deployment.

## BeS Environments

An automated script which helps a security professional with setting up security environments for vulnerability assessments and patching.

## BeS Playbook

An automated script defining the steps for security related activities such as vulnerability assessments, exploit simulation etc.
